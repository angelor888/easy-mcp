# Easy-MCP ― July 7 2025 Troubleshooting Session Report  
_Angelo Russoniello & Claude_

---

## 1  Goal  

Repair a broken Docker Compose stack (Easy-MCP), wire the four MCP containers to Claude Desktop & Claude Code, commit a formal SOP to GitHub, and make future startup totally painless.

---

## 2  Timeline of What Happened  

| Time (PDT) | Action / Event | Result |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| **11:24** | Started session; `docker compose up` threw `yaml: could not find expected ':'` (line 29). | Identified stray **"W"** at top of `docker-compose.yml`. |
| **11:45** | Fixed stray char; hit `mapping key "ports" already defined`. | Removed duplicate `ports:` block in `mcp-filesystem`. |
| **12:05** | Multiple curl tests reset connection. | Realized MCP protocol ≠ HTTP (curl failures expected). |
| **12:20 – 13:10** | Corrected every `ports:` mapping & indentation. | Final mapping:<br>8082→filesystem<br>8084→puppeteer<br>8085→memory<br>8086→everything |
| **13:15** | Added global Git identity (`angelor888 / angelo@duetright.com`). | Commit succeeded. |
| **13:25** | Created **docs/mcp-setup-sop.md**, committed & pushed to `origin/main`. | File live on GitHub. |
| **13:30** | Posted SOP to Slack **#sop-library** via Slack CLI. | Team visibility ✅ |
| **13:34** | Added alias `claude-mcp` (`cd ~/easy-mcp && claude`). | One-word CLI launch. |
| **13:40** | Confirmed `docker compose ps` shows correct host ports and all containers **Up**. | Infrastructure green. |

## 3  Final Good State  

```text
docker compose ps
NAME                      PORTS
mcp-filesystem   0.0.0.0:8082->8082/tcp
mcp-puppeteer    0.0.0.0:8084->8084/tcp
mcp-memory       0.0.0.0:8085->8085/tcp
mcp-everything   0.0.0.0:8086->8086/tcp
```

**Claude Desktop MCP status:**
```
✓ filesystem  localhost:8082 (docker)
✓ puppeteer   localhost:8084 (docker)
✓ memory      localhost:8085 (docker)
✓ everything  localhost:8086 (docker)
```

## 4  Key Fixes Applied  

1. **Stray character**: Removed "W" prefix from line 1 of `docker-compose.yml`
2. **Duplicate keys**: Eliminated redundant `ports:` declarations
3. **Indentation**: Standardized to 4 spaces before `ports:`, 6 before dash
4. **Port mappings**: Corrected all services to use their designated ports
5. **Git identity**: Configured global user settings for commits
6. **CLI alias**: Added `claude-mcp` for quick access
