# Configuration for mcp-brave-search service API key:
# The BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY for the 'mcp-brave-search' service is managed via Docker Secrets.
# Create a file named 'brave_api_key.txt' in the root of the project and place your API key there.
# This file is specified in the 'docker-compose.yml' and should not be committed to Git (see .gitignore).

# Example of other environment variables that might be needed by other services:
# OTHER_ENV_VAR=example_value
# SOME_OTHER_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# ANOTHER_VARIABLE=some_value
